# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Pull Request validation

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  # push:
  #   branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, edited]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
